        <h2>History of Hip Hop</h2>
        <p> <em>Hip-hop</em> <!---The word hip hop is italized--> began as a cultural movement in the streets of New York during the 1970’s (Rose, 1994). Much more diverse than what the media today perceives it to be, hip-hop is expressed through a variety of artistic and cultural mediums, including, but not limited to, music, dance, graffiti, and fashion (Marriot, 1990). Of the various art forms expressed through hip-hop culture, hip-hop music began to develop as a local underground art form, with lyrics that spoke out on urban poverty, racism, and a growing sense of economic abandonment in African-American inner city neighborhoods (Rose, 1994; George, 1998). Thus, hip-hop became a voice for African-American youth, who saw it as a way to express the social, economic and political realities of their lives (Alridge & Steward, 2005).</p>
